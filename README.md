Assignments for Northwestern MSDS-422 Practical Machine Learning

# Overview of Course
MSDS-422 Practical Machine Learning is one of the distribution requirements of the Northwestern Masters in Data Science (MSDS) program.  This is a survey course to introduce students to a variety of machine learning modeling techniques, from regression through to NLP and image classification.

Each week's homework assignment required us to participate in a Kaggle competition that addressed the key skills and techniques on deck for that week.  The Professor, Larry Fulton, encouraged us to "stand on the shoulders of giants", and expected us to find code examples to use as a jump start for our projects.

The structure of the class also emphasized the introduction of new tools.  For example, in one week we were expected to build purely OLS regressions; in the subsequent week we introduced regularization.  Obviously, performance in the second week was better than the first.
